    <p>This is my final project for TECHNOLOGY FOR DESIGN EXPERIMENT 2502243 (2024/2).
    Inspired by "Eat That Frog," this project turns life's challenges into energy for growth. 
    Through soba, we reflect on our experiences, clear our minds, and restart with purpose. 
    At Jojo Soba, every bite symbolizes 
    a fresh startâ€”balancing reflection, renewal, and readiness for what's next.</p>
